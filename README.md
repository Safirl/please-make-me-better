## Synopsis 
In a near-future dystopia, scientific advancements have made it possible to alter the human mind. Corporations have seized upon these discoveries to offer the creation of a superior human being — more confident, more intelligent, more eloquent. While some use this technology to become better versions of themselves, others exploit it to control the minds of others.
You are an employee at one of these companies. Every day, you receive client requests and attempt to modify their subconscious using your configurator. But altering the very soul carries a moral weight. The more extravagant the requests become, the more tormented you feel. Where does the limit of your ethics lie — and will you be able to bear the consequences?
